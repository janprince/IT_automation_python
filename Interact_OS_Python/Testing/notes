One of the tasks that programmers had to do when writing code is test it to make sure that it behaves the way that they expected to.
Having good tests for our software can help us catch mistakes, errors, and bugs before we deploy our scripts to perform
real-world automation tasks.

# The most basic way of testing a script is to run it with different parameters and see if it returns the expected values.

# Executing a script with different command-line arguments to see how its behavior changed is an example of manual testing.
    Using the interpreter to try our code before putting it in a script is another form of manual testing.


# Formal software testing takes us process a step further, codifying tests into its own software and code that can be run
    to verify that our programs do what we expect them to do.
    This is called automatic testing.

   # The goal of automatic testing is to automate the process of checking if the returned value matches the expectations.
