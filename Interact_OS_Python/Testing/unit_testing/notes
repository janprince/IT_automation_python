# Unit tests are used to verify that small, isolated parts of a program are correct.

# Unit tests are generally written alongside the code to test the behavior of individual pieces or units like functions or methods.
    Unit tests help assure the developer that each piece of code does what it's meant to do.

# An important characteristic of a unit test is isolation.
    Unit test should only test the unit of code they target, the function or method that's being tested.
